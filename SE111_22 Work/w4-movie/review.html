                <p>A Silent Voice is a great movie in my opinion. It is everything I love about movires. The characters are so likable and the story kept me interested as it progressed. All the voice actors that were involved did a fantastic Job, I don't think there was anything I disliked about it.<br><br>My Favorite voice actor in this has to be Miyu Irino because he gave such a stellar performance voicing Shoya.</p>
